Faker API

In this assignment, we will be using 2 Javascript libraries to create a simple API that generates User and Company objects depending on the requested route. The libraries we will be using are Express for the server and Faker for the random data generation. The goal is to start broadening our understanding of APIs.

For this assignment, you are tasked with creating User and Company objects

User Object
password
email
phoneNumber
lastName
firstName
_id

Company Object
_id
name
address
street
city
state
zipCode

Faker
The faker library has a ton of methods we can use to populate specific fields with randomly generated data.

You can find faker's installation instructions here, as well as some basic examples of the library in action.
